#This model essentially just uses the mean of y as a predictor of y. This may seem silly but this is essentially what you compare all more complex models against.


Linear: Ordinary Least Squares Regression
Can sometimes make things linear by doing the log transformation of the data 
S =cA^2 to logS = log c + z log A
y = b + mx

Epsilon = E = the points around the regression linefor the residuals, should have a variance of sigma squared

Beta = partial slopes, assigning a partial effect to each variable to explain the overal variation. Allows us to statistically control what we couldn't control by design
```{r}
null_mod = lm(fruit_mass_mg ~ 1, data = weeds)
null_mod
```
```{r}
mean(weeds$fruit_mass_mg)
```

```{r}
plot(fruit_mass_mg ~ 1, data = weeds)
abline(null_mod, lwd = 2)
abline(h = mean(weeds$fruit_mass_mg), col = 'red', lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```


Assuming an effect, 
```{r}
trt_mod = lm(fruit_mass_mg ~ trt, data = weeds)
# alternatively we can just update null_mod
trt_mod = update(null_mod, . ~ . + trt) #dot to keep the same parts in there and just add on that one variable, can also use it to drop a variable with a -
ht_mod = update(null_mod, . ~ . + plant_ht_cm)
trt_mod
```
intercept for trtunfertilized = 20.1 -3.39
The way the model is actually build by the computer is to take the model and unpacks it to a dummy matrix, of 0s and 1s, so all columns sum to 1, so only need one parameter beyon the intercept to understand it

```{r}
contrasts(weeds$trt)
```


```{r}
ht_mod
```

```{r}
levels (weeds$trt)
contrasts (weeds$trt)
```
#In this case we have a factor trt that only has two levels so it only #requires one binary variable because if a sample is not fertilized then it must be unfertilized. That may seem a little strange but just remember that if you have a factor with k levels then you need k - 1 binary variables to specify that factor as a set of orthogonal contrasts. This explains why the treatment variable only requires a single regression coefficient.

Sometimes we have factors that are ranked such as low, medium, high. In this case the variable is called ordinal as opposed to our nomial treatment variable. The contrasts of ordinal variables are not as simple to specify and typically a Helmert polynomial contrasts are used.

Letâ€™s examine these models graphically.


```{r}

     xlab = 'Plant height (cm)', ylab = 'Fruit mass (mg)')
abline(ht_mod) #don't usually put these lines on there, often time treated as if ANOVA is different than regression, it is the same thing, just a diffrent way to present the results, line still goes through the middle of the boxplot data sets
```
```{r}

     xlim = c(-0.25, 1.25),
     xlab = 'Treatment', ylab = 'Fruit mass (mg)', frame.plot = T)
points(rep(0, 20), weeds$fruit_mass_mg[weeds$trt == 'fertilized'])
points(rep(1, 20), weeds$fruit_mass_mg[weeds$trt == 'unfertilized'])

axis(side = 2)

      geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
      labs(x = 'Treatment', y = 'Fruit mass (mg)')

      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
      labs(x = 'Plant height (cm)', y = 'Fruit mass (mg)')

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

```{r}
main_mod = lm(fruit_mass_mg ~ trt + plant_ht_cm, data = weeds)
main_mod
```

```{r}
xrange = range(weeds$plant_ht_cm)

plot(fruit_mass_mg ~ plant_ht_cm, data = weeds, type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Plant height (cm)', ylab = 'Fruit mass (mg)')
points(fruit_mass_mg ~ plant_ht_cm, data = weeds, subset = trt == "fertilized",
       pch = 1, col = 'red')
# add the fitted regression line using two points at either end of the range of x 
lines(xrange, 
      predict(main_mod, 
              newdata = data.frame(plant_ht_cm = xrange, trt = "fertilized")),
      col = 'red', lty = 1)
points(fruit_mass_mg ~ plant_ht_cm, data = weeds, subset = trt == "unfertilized",
       pch = 2, col = 'blue')

      predict(main_mod,

legend('topleft', c('Fertilized', 'Unfertilized'), col = c('red', 'blue'), 
       pch = c(1, 2), lty = c(1, 2), bty = 'n')
```
#Above in the R code we used a new function predict(). This function is useful for taking a fitted model and using it to predict values. In this case we use this feature to predict where two points fall along the x-axis so that we can connect them with lines and thus form the fitted regression lines. One of the more difficult arguments to predict() to understand is the newdata argument. This is essentially a data.frame that must have the variables in the model included as column names. So in this case must have the variables plant_ht_cm and trt in newdata.

```{r}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(weeds[ , c('trt', 'plant_ht_cm', 'fruit_mass_mg')], 
                     type = 'h', color = 'blue', angle = 65, pch = 16, 
                     lab = c(3, 5), xlim = c(0, 3),
                     x.ticklabs = c('', 'fertilized', 'unfertilized', ''), 
                     box = F) 
# Add regression plane
s3d$plane3d(main_mod) #multiple regression is fitting this plane to the plot
```

```{r}
int_mod = lm(fruit_mass_mg ~ trt + plant_ht_cm + trt:plant_ht_cm,
              data = weeds)
# alternatively we can use * as short hand
int_mod = lm(fruit_mass_mg ~ trt * plant_ht_cm, data = weeds)
int_mod
```
Close to 0, meaning that there probably isn't an interaction effect

#The multiple R-squared and adjusted R-squared provide estimates of variance explained. The later statistic adjusts for the number of variables included in the model. The F-statistic is a ratio of the mean sum of squares for the model to the sum of squares of the residuals (i.e., the ratio of explained variance to unexplained variance). The p-value associated with the F-statistic provides a means of examining the statistics significance of the entire model.

    par(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
    r <- abs(cor(x, y))
    txt <- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits = digits)[1]
    txt <- paste0(prefix, txt)
    if(missing(cex.cor)) 
        cex.cor <- 0.8/strwidth(txt)
    text(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor)
}
```

Before standardizing variables it is worthwhile to highlight that the relationship between correlation and regression statistics. Specifically, the t-statistic from a simple correlation coefficient is exactly what is reported for the Î²1 coefficient in a regression model.

```{r}
cor.test(sim_data$y, sim_data$x1)$statistic
```

```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x1, data=sim_data))$coef
```

```{r}
sim_data_std = data.frame(scale(sim_data))

mod = lm(y  ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data=sim_data)
mod_std = lm(y  ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data=sim_data_std)
round(summary(mod)$coef, 3)
```

```{r}
round(summary(mod_std)$coef, 3)
```

```{r}
cor(sim_data$y, sim_data$x1)
```
```{r}
cor(sim_data$y, sim_data$x2)
```

```{r}
cor(sim_data$y, sim_data$x3)
```
Notice that above the t-statistics and consequently the p-values between mod and mod_std donâ€™t change (with the exception of the intercept term which is always 0 in a regression of standardized variables). This is because the t-statistic is a pivotal statistic meaning that its value doesnâ€™t depend on the scale of the difference.

Additionally notice that the individual correlation coefficients are very similar to the Î² estimates in mod_std. Why are these not exactly the same? Hereâ€™s a hint - what would happen if their was strong multicollinarity between the explanatory variables?

Letâ€™s plot the variables against one another and also display their individual Pearson correlation coefficients to get a visual perspective on the problem

```{r}
pairs(sim_data, lower.panel = panel.smooth, upper.panel = panel.cor)
```
```{r}
lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x1*x2 + x1*x3 + x2*x3 + x1*x2*x3, data=sim_data)
```
```{r}
# or you can simply update the main effects model
mod_full = update(mod_main, ~ . + x1*x2*x3)
summary(mod_full)
```
```{r}
# we can carry out a nested model comparison
anova(mod_main, mod_full)
```
```{r}
# examine the AIC scores of the two models, smaller number is better
AIC(mod_full)
```
```{r}
AIC(mod_main)
```
```{r}
stepAIC(mod_full)
```

```{r}
health <- rnorm(100,10,2)
hist(health)
predictors <- replicate(100, rnorm(1000, 0, 1))
head(predictors)
```
```{r}
mod <-lm (health ~ predictors)
summary(mod)
```


Interpolation vs. Extrapolation
Interpolation allows us to predict growth anywhere on this graph, based on your data, extrapolation is anywhere outside the graph. Interpolation works really well, but extrapolating can easily fail. 

Cross validation
Looking at your data and fitting it to 1 half of your data and then using it to predict the other half and then checking it against that.
